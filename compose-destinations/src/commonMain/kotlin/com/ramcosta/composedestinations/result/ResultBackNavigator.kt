 * manually calling that Composable, then you can use
 * [com.ramcosta.composedestinations.manualcomposablecalls.resultBackNavigator]
 * extension function to get a correctly typed implementation.
 *
 * Type safety related limitations (compile time enforced):
 * - [R] must be one of String, Boolean, Float, Int, Long, Serializable, or Parcelable.
 * They can be nullable.
 * - [R] type cannot have type arguments itself (f.e you can't use Array<String> even though it is Serializable)
 * - Each annotated Composable can have at most one parameter of type [ResultBackNavigator]
 *
 * @see [com.ramcosta.composedestinations.result.ResultRecipient]
